# hunted-vs-hunter

A simulation of a maritime environment of prey hunting, including, but not
limited to, sharks, sardines and tuna. This project was intended as an exercise
in Java based on the [BlueJ](www.bluej.org) Textbook.

## About

The idea of this project was to create a simulation of a aquatic ambient with
sharks, sardines, tunas and seaweeds. We were supposed to practice the concepts
of abstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism and heritage.

It is supposed to emulate an environment where there are a lot of preys and
predators trying to survive (hence the name of the project).

## Compiling and running

To compile the program, simply execute `make` on the project root. It might be
necessary to change the `JAVA_HOME` variable on the Makefile depending on where
Java is installed on you system.

After compiling, a file called `hxh.jar` should be present in the root
directory. To execute it on the command line, use `make run`.

Ps.: For OpenBSD users, you'll need to use the GNU's version of `make`, which is
downloadable via the package `gmake`.
